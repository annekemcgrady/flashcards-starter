# Flashcards 

Flashcards is the first project of FE Mod 2 for the 1903 cohort.  This project used object oriented programming concepts using classes.  The intent was to use Test Driven Development (TDD) to guide the writing of all code in the class creation files.  This project also made use of linting to correct syntax, spacing and other errors in the code.
